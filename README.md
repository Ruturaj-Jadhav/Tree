## Introduction

Tree-Productivity is an innovative web-based application that reimagines traditional to-do lists by introducing a hierarchical, tree-like structure for task management. It offers users a more organized and flexible approach to managing complex projects and multifaceted responsibilities.

## Problem Statement

As students and professionals juggle multiple projects, responsibilities, and deadlines, traditional linear to-do lists often fall short in effectively organizing tasks in a structured, hierarchical manner. Tree-Productivity addresses this limitation by providing an intuitive, tree-based structure for task organization, allowing users to better manage complex projects and nested subtasks.

## System Architecture

Tree-Productivity follows a client-server architecture with the following main components:

- **Front-end**: Built with EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating), providing dynamic HTML generation for complex, nested structures.
- **Back-end**: Developed with Node.js, handling user authentication, task management, and data operations.
- **Database**: Utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store the hierarchical task structure and user data.

## Key Features

1. **Card Management**: 
   - Create multiple cards representing main tasks or categories
   - Intuitive interface for adding, editing, and deleting cards

2. **Subtask Management**:
   - Create subtasks within each card
   - Support for both simple tasks and links to new screens

3. **Recursive Embedding**:
   - Implement infinitely nestable task structures
   - Open new screens for subtasks, creating a true tree-like organization

4. **Access Management**:
   - Add team members to specific cards and subtasks
   - Control access rights throughout the nested structure

5. **User Dashboard**:
   - Personalized view of tasks and projects
   - Easy navigation through the hierarchical structure

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating)
- **Back-end**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Development Tools**: VSCode, Git for version control

### Why This Stack?

- **EJS**: Enables dynamic HTML generation, crucial for rendering complex, nested task structures.
- **Node.js**: Provides a JavaScript runtime for the backend, allowing for consistency between frontend and backend languages.
- **MongoDB**: Its flexible, document-based structure aligns well with the hierarchical nature of the task cards.

## Future Enhancements

1. Mobile Application: Develop a responsive mobile version for on-the-go task management.
2. Data Visualization: Implement graphical representations of task hierarchies and completion status.
3. Integration Capabilities: Allow integration with calendar applications and other project management tools.
4. Advanced Collaboration Features: Enhance team collaboration capabilities with real-time updates and communication tools.
